# Semantic_Similarity
Given a text and a reason, predict if text satisfies the reason. You can use the train file for any training and report metrics on evaluation file.
## **Dataset information**

- The CSV files have 3 columns
    - text
    - reason: a short description
    - label:
        - 0: text does not satisfy the reason
        - 1: text satisfies the reason
- The dataset has been cleaned to a certain extent. You can probe more.

**Note**: Small train dataset with only positive samples is intentional.
